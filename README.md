# DCSS-JavaSpace-Assignment
Assignment 1 – Creating a forum using Apache Jini library. I recieved an A+ for the implementation of this assignment.

This assignment's goal was to create a bulletin board system using Apache Jini's JavaSpace API. This was for the Distributed and Client Server Systems module in my final year of university.

Users and register, create topics and comment on topics whilst interacting with other users on the server.

The UI uses JavaFX.
